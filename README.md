# basalt

> NOTICE: Basalt will be ported to SDL2 in the future as I don't want to touch WinAPI or Xlib ever again.

Game engine for C cavemen, designed for an anthro Touhou clone.

Slowly solidifying [Magma Game Engine](https://github.com/bramtechs/RaylibMagmaEngine) and [dream-emu](https://github.com/bramtechs/dream-emu).

Inspired by [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/).
