Software rendered game engine based on SDL3 for C++ cavemen

Solidified version of [Magma Game Engine](https://github.com/bramtechs/RaylibMagmaEngine) and [dream-emu](https://github.com/bramtechs/dream-emu).

Inspired by [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/).

## Dependencies

Windows 8/10/11
- Visual Studio 22 or latest VS Build Tools

Open with Visual Studio or compile via MSBuild.

**SDL3 (master branch of SDL) is now statically compiled with basalt, so no extra DLLs are needed!**
